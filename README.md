## Challenge Commentary
### Time
This project required 1 hour and 10 minutes to complete. This included implementing the Stretch feature and some minor styling. This time doesn't include approximately 20 minutes of reviewing the challenge documentation, analyzing the structure of the API data, and planning the best method of implementation including the stretch feature. The project time also doesn't include time required to create this documentation.

### Next Steps
1. Implement additional styling to provide a better user experience.
2. Implement search, filter, or sort functionality. For example, the user can search by name, or filter by province, or perhaps sort by moisture content.
